# Snap! Project Embed

A MediaWiki extension for embedding Snap! projects

# Usage

- Loading a project with Snap<i>!</i>'s default width and height:
  `<snap project="project-name" user="user" />`
- Loading a project with custom width and height:
- `<snap project="project-name" user="user" width="width" height="height" />`
- Loading a project without showing the title and author of the project (defaults to true):
  `<snap project="project-name" user="user" width="width" taa="false" />`
- Loading a project without the edit button (defaults to true):
  `<snap project="project-name" user="user" edit="false" />`
- Loading a project without the pause button (defaults to true):
  `<snap project="project-name" user="user" pause="false" />`
- Loading a project inside a HTML details tag to make it visible only after an arrow has been clicked (defaults to false):
  `<snap project="project-name" user="user" hide="true" />`

You can also use the extension like this- `<snap project="project-name" user="user"></snap>`. Additionally, instead of using the `<snap>` tag, you can also use the `<snap-project>` tag.
